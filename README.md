# Lattice-PRNG
Lattice-PRNG aims to build a quantum secure pseudorandom generator using lattices.
# Stages
1. Research on theoretical concepts of Pseudorandom functions and generators.
2. Homomorphic function & Lattices analysis and concrete foundation
3. Library for generating LWE vectors
4. Implementation of homomorphic function based on 4 on LFSR
5. Testing
